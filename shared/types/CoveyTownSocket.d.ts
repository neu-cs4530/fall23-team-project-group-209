/*
 * UNO Game Types
 * The following info is necessary to properly handle the UNO model. There are 108 cards and the following will 
 * Represent them and how they are handled.
 * There are the following card types:
 * Number Cards, Action Cards, and Draw Cards
 * 
 * NUMBER CARDS:
 * There are 76 number cards, of which there are four color sets: 
 * red, green, yellow, blue
 * 
 * Each of these sets has one '0' card and two of each number from '1' to '9'
 * 
 * ACTION CARDS:
 * Each color set has two of each action card:
 * Skip: The next player in sequence misses a turn.
 * Reverse: The direction of play changes (clockwise to counterclockwise, or vice versa).
 * The game starts clockwise, btw.
 * 
 * The following are considered action cards but are separate from the color sets.
 * Wild: There are four of these cards in a deck, and they can be played regardless of the color in play. 
 * The player who plays it gets to choose the color that continues play.
 * 
 * DRAW CARDS:
 * Draw cards add cards to the draw stack. If the subsequent player does not have a draw card they must draw the 
 * ENTIRE draw stack. 
 * 
 * Each color set has two of the following:
 * Draw Two: The card adds two cards to the draw stack. Can only be played if the corresponding color or a wildcard is the 
 * last card played.
 * 
 * Wild Draw Four: There are also four of these cards in a deck.
 * This card can be played at all times.
